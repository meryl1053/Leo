**Explanation:**

1. **Import math module:** This line imports the `math` module, which contains the `sqrt` function for calculating the square root.
2. **Define the `pythagoras` function:**
   - It takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, representing the lengths of the two legs.
   - It calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b` (a² + b²) using `math.sqrt()`, which gives the hypotenuse (`c`).
   - It returns the calculated hypotenuse.
3. **Get user input:** The code prompts the user to enter the lengths of the two legs using `input()` and converts them to floating-point numbers using `float()`.
4. **Calculate hypotenuse:** It calls the `pythagoras` function with the user-provided values and stores the result in the `hypotenuse` variable.
5. **Print the result:** The final line uses an f-string to print the calculated hypotenuse in a user-friendly format.
