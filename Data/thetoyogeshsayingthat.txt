Please give me more information about what you want to say to Yogesh! 

For example:

* **What is the purpose of the message?**  (To thank him, to request something, to invite him somewhere, to share news, etc.)
* **What is the tone of the message?** (Formal, informal, friendly, etc.)
* **Are there any specific details you want to include?** 


Once I have this information, I can write a message to Yogesh that is clear, concise, and effective.
