Please tell me more about what you'd like me to write! 

For example:

* **What is the purpose of the letter?** (Is it a thank you note, a request, a complaint, an invitation, etc.?)
* **Who is the recipient?** (Knowing this will help me determine the appropriate tone and level of formality.)
* **What are the key points you want to convey?** 
* **Is there a particular style or tone you'd like me to use?** (Formal, informal, friendly, professional, etc.)


The more information you give me, the better I can tailor the letter to your needs.
